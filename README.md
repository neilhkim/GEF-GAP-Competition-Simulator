# GEF-GAP-Competition-Simulator

Repository for the paper Bimodality in Ras signaling originates from processivity of the Ras activator SOS without classic kinetic bistability.

This repository stores the source codes of the programs used to model the stochastic Ras GEF-GAP competition reaction studied in the paper.

## Code requirements:
- Symbolic Math Toolbox.
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.
